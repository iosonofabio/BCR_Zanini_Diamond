## BCR Analysis for Zanini and Diamond collaboration
The content of the folders are:
- `pipeline`: the `cellranger` scripts for computing the gene expression table and the assembled VDJ + constant chains
- `clones`: the scripts to generate the figures
- `pilots`: early scripts for QC, testing, etc. Chances are you don't want to spend too much time here, but you are of course welcome to.

Have fun.
